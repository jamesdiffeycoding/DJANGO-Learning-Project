# Django Learning Tool

## Inspiration
As a new developer, it is easy to get stuck in a bubble learning just one programming language and never daring to venture outside of it. **So I wondered, what would it be like to step outside of that bubble for myself?**?

I recently stepped out of my bubble into the world of Ruby on Rails. Now I'm stepping into Python and Django, in part due hearing about some incredible roles that use them..

<!-- ## What it does -->
<!-- Description of the project  -->

<!-- ## How we built it -->
<!--  -->

<!-- ## Challenges we ran into -->
<!--  -->

<!-- ## Accomplishments that we're proud of -->
<!-- Developing my first programming language project outside of JavaScript or TypeScript, and being brave enough to seek advice from a Ruby developer and friend. -->

<!-- ## What I learned -->
<!-- Ruby on Rails provides some very useful scaffolding commands that quickly provide CRUD functionality. In JavaScript, far more coding effort is required to produce the same result, although doing so can provide greater control and familiarity with the codebase. -->

<!-- When setting up the project, I mistakenly called it "pokemon". This meant that "pokemon" became a reserved word, and so I ended up calling the individual pokemon datapoints "pokemonsters" rather than 'pokemon'. This leads to some buttons refering to "pokemonsters" and some referring to "pokemon". Now I know! -->

## Built with
Python, Django, HTML, CSS

<!-- ## Try it out -->
<!-- [Ruby on Rails Pokedex Deployment](https://rubyonrails-pokedex.onrender.com/pokemonsters) -->

# Guidance for any other JavaScript developers wanting to try making a clone of the project - an A to Z guide:
I suggest breaking this up into chunks.

## Installations
* Install Python. This may be easier on Windows and Linux rathre than Apple devices.

## Project scaffolding and setup
* ...

## Styling
...

## Deployment
